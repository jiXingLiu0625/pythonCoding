Price per liter
Suppose you are at the grocery store to buy soda and you want to get the
best deal. Write a program that reads in the price of a six-pack of soda
and the price of a two-liter bottle. The program should print out the price
per liter for both assuming that cans are 12 oz or 0.355 liters
