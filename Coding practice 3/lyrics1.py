Write a program to print the lyrics of the song "Old MacDonald." Your program
should print the lyrics for five different animals (five verses), similar to
the example verse below:

Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
And on that farm he had a cow, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
With a moo, moo here and a moo, moo there.
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo, moo.
Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
