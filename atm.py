ATM

This is a project to design an ATM. the purpose for dispense money using coins
and bills a possible. the machine can dispense the following denominations:
$50, $20, $10, $5, $2, $1, $0.25, $0.10, $0.05. Assume the input will alawys
be non-negative.

    Withdrawing money from ATM, input a single float number to print exactly
    bills and coins based on denominations.
